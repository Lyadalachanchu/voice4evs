# Voice4EVs Backend

This backend provides a CSMS (Central System Management System) for OCPP 1.6 communication with charge points, including a custom OCPP simulator.

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Start both CSMS and OCPP Simulator
docker-compose up --build

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

### Manual Setup

1. **Start CSMS:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python csms.py
   ```

2. **Start REST API (optional):**
   ```bash
   python rest_api.py
   ```

3. **Start Charge Point Simulator (in another terminal):**
   ```bash
   python cp_sim.py
   ```

## What This Provides

- **CSMS WebSocket Server**: `ws://localhost:9000/EVSE001`
- **REST API**: `http://localhost:8000` - Monitor connections and send commands
- **OCPP Simulator**: Simulates a charge point with BootNotification, StatusNotification, and Heartbeat messages

## API Endpoints

### System Commands

#### 1. Check System Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/status
```
**What it does:** Shows all connected charge points, their current status, heartbeat information, and total connection count.

#### 2. Get API Information
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
```
**What it does:** Shows the API overview, currently connected charge points, and lists all available commands.

### Charge Point Management Commands

All charge point commands follow this pattern: `POST /commands/{action}/{cp_id}` where `cp_id` is the charge point ID (currently `EVSE001`).

#### 3. Reset Charge Point
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/commands/reset/EVSE001 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "Hard"}'
```
**What it does:** Sends a reset command to the charge point. Options:
- `"Hard"` - Hard reset (reboots the entire system)
- `"Soft"` - Soft reset (restarts only the OCPP communication)

#### 4. Change Availability
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/commands/change_availability/EVSE001 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "Inoperative", "connector_id": 1}'
```
**What it does:** Changes the availability status of a charge point or specific connector. Options:
- `"Operative"` - Makes the charge point/connector available for charging
- `"Inoperative"` - Makes it unavailable for charging
- `connector_id` (optional) - Target specific connector, omit for entire charge point

#### 5. Change Configuration
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/commands/change_configuration/EVSE001 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key": "HeartbeatInterval", "value": "60"}'
```
**What it does:** Changes configuration parameters on the charge point. Common keys:
- `"HeartbeatInterval"` - Time between heartbeats (seconds)
- `"MeterValueSampleInterval"` - How often to send meter readings
- `"NumberOfConnectors"` - Number of physical connectors

#### 6. Remote Start Transaction
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/commands/remote_start/EVSE001 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id_tag": "USER123", "connector_id": 1}'
```
**What it does:** Remotely starts a charging session. Parameters:
- `id_tag` - User identification (RFID card, app ID, etc.)
- `connector_id` (optional) - Specific connector to use

#### 7. Remote Stop Transaction
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/commands/remote_stop/EVSE001 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"transaction_id": 1}'
```
**What it does:** Stops an active charging session. Parameters:
- `transaction_id` - The transaction ID from when charging started

#### 8. Unlock Connector
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/commands/unlock_connector/EVSE001 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"connector_id": 1}'
```
**What it does:** Unlocks the physical connector (releases the charging cable). Parameters:
- `connector_id` - Which connector to unlock

## Real-time Monitoring

Your system is currently running with:
- **CSMS**: WebSocket server on port 9000, REST API on port 8000
- **Charge Point Simulator**: `EVSE001` connected and sending heartbeats every 30 seconds
- **Status**: Available (ready for charging)

## System Management

### Start the system:
```bash
cd backend
docker-compose up --build
```

### Stop the system:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### View logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

## Testing

1. **Check connection status:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/status
   ```

2. **View CSMS logs** to see OCPP messages

3. **OCPP Simulator** will automatically connect and send standard OCPP messages

The system is fully functional and ready for testing OCPP 1.6 commands! The charge point simulator will continue running and responding to commands until you stop the Docker containers.

## ðŸŽ­ Demo Scenarios for Voice Agent Testing

The system includes **5 scriptable demo scenarios** that simulate real-world EV charging issues for voice agent demonstrations:

### Available Demo Scenarios

#### 1. **Session Start Failure** - "It says it's available but nothing happens"
- **Issue**: Charger shows `Available` but won't start transactions after authorization
- **Voice Agent Solution**: Detects no power flow, sends `Reset(Soft)`, asks user to try again
- **Demo Command**: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/demo/trigger/session_start_failure`

#### 2. **Stuck Connector** - "It won't unlock, I can't unplug"
- **Issue**: Connector stays locked after charging with `ConnectorLockFailure`
- **Voice Agent Solution**: Sends `UnlockConnector`, confirms user can remove cable
- **Demo Command**: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/demo/trigger/stuck_connector`

#### 3. **Offline Charger** - "The charger is offline"
- **Issue**: No heartbeats, charger appears offline in app
- **Voice Agent Solution**: Sends `Reset(Hard)`, waits for reconnection, files ticket if needed
- **Demo Command**: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/demo/trigger/offline_charger`

#### 4. **Auth Failure** - "It keeps saying my card is invalid"
- **Issue**: `Authorize` returns `Invalid` for valid cards
- **Voice Agent Solution**: Adds card to whitelist via `SendLocalList`, resets charger
- **Demo Command**: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/demo/trigger/auth_failure`

#### 5. **Slow Charging** - "Charging is very slow"
- **Issue**: `MeterValues` show very low power output
- **Voice Agent Solution**: Explains load sharing, tries `Reset(Soft)`, provides reassurance
- **Demo Command**: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/demo/trigger/slow_charging`

### Demo Management Commands

```bash
# List all available scenarios
curl http://localhost:8000/demo/scenarios

# Trigger a specific scenario
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/demo/trigger/{scenario_name}

# Clear all active scenarios
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/demo/clear

# Add a card to whitelist (for auth failure resolution)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/commands/send_local_list/EVSE001 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id_tag": "NEWCARD123", "status": "Accepted"}'
```

### Automated Demo Script

Run the complete demo sequence automatically:

```bash
# Install demo dependencies
pip install aiohttp

# Run all demo scenarios
python demo_script.py
```

This will run through all 5 scenarios with realistic voice agent responses, showing how an automated system can resolve common EV charging issues.

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure ports 9000 and 8000 are available
- Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
- For manual setup, ensure all Python dependencies are installed
