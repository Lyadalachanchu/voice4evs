# ⚡ Agentic AI for EV Charging Stations
*Voice-powered customer support that actually solves your problem.*

---

<!-- ## 🚙 1. The Story (Customer POV) -->
**Imagine this:**  
You're driving late at night, low on battery, and the EV charger won’t start.  
You call support → wait 20 minutes → explain your issue → get transferred around.  
Frustrating. Stressful. Time wasted.  

**Now imagine this:**  
You speak to a voice assistant at the station:  
*"My car is charging slowly. Can you see what the problem is?"*  
The bot understands, authenticates, fixes the backend issue, and your charging is back to normal.  

---

## ❌  The Problem
- Long wait times for EV driver support  
- Repetitive calls & no instant resolutions  
- Businesses struggle with scale and costs  
<!-- - Customers lose trust in EV infrastructure   -->
