**Imagine this:**  
You're driving late at night, low on battery, and the EV charger wonâ€™t start.  
You call support â†’ wait 20 minutes â†’ explain your issue â†’ get transferred around.  
Frustrating. Stressful. Time wasted.  

**Now imagine this:**  
You speak to a voice assistant at the station:  
*"My car is charging slowly. Can you see what the problem is?"*  
The bot understands, authenticates, fixes the backend issue, and your charging is back to normal.

## The Problem
- Long wait times for EV driver support  
- Repetitive calls & no instant resolutions  
- Businesses struggle with scale and costs; with increasing number of chargers, the customer support calls are more variable: people tend to charge at specific peak times. This is the reason existing human only EV customer support firms are going bankrupt. And number of charging points is only growing faster YoY.

## Our Solution
**Agentic AI Voice Bot for EV Charging**  
- **Natural conversation**: Voice-first assistant -> You don't want to pull out your laptop to write an email on the road.
- **Backend actions**: Not just chat â†’ *performs real fixes* (fix charger configuration, reset charger, unplug charger etc)  
- **Always-on and scalable**: 24/7 available + scales on demand
- **Realistic**: Uses the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) 1.6 protocol, a protocol that almost all chargers use to communicate with the Chargining Station Management System software (CSMS). This means our agent can be dropped into an existing charging network with minimal changes to it!

## ðŸ’¡ Innovation
Unlike typical chatbotsâ€¦  
- Old bots â†’ FAQ only, no real action; performance measured in "deflection rates", meaning goal is to get you off the phone rather than to actually solve your problem.
- Our bot â†’ *Understands + Executes*  
- True **agentic behavior**: takes steps autonomously  
- **Modular**: Can easily be extended to use cases other than the EV charger ecosystem
- Only truly challenging problems will be escalated to qualified human technicians
