# ⚡ Agentic AI for EV Charging Stations
*Voice-powered customer support that actually solves your problem.*

<!-- ## 🚙 1. The Story (Customer POV) -->
**Imagine this:**  
You're driving late at night, low on battery, and the EV charger won’t start.  
You call support → wait 20 minutes → explain your issue → get transferred around.  
Frustrating. Stressful. Time wasted.  

**Now imagine this:**  
You speak to a voice assistant at the station:  
*"Start charging my car, my app isn’t working."*  
The bot understands, authenticates, fixes the backend issue, and your EV starts charging in seconds.
